    <p>This is going to be short, but I made this website because I was bored and wanted to help gamers in school.</p>
<p>Though kinda took the idea from a random dude on tiktok saying he has the biggest website for unblocked games.</p>
<p>Also my friend is making an unblocked games website too,
I am not trying to make it as a rivally thing but just to do something I have been wanting to do for a bit.</p>
<p>Any ways cool things are coming soon.</p>
